	  On servers configured to perform DNSSEC validation using
	  managed trust anchors (i.e., keys configured explicitly
	  via <command>managed-keys</command>, or implicitly 
	  via <command>dnssec-validation auto;</command> or
	  <command>dnssec-lookaside auto;</command>), revoking
	  a trust anchor and sending a new untrusted replacement
	  could cause <command>named</command> to crash with an
	  assertion failure. This could occur in the event of a
	  botched key rollover, or potentially as a result of a
	  deliberate attack if the attacker was in position to
	  monitor the victim's DNS traffic.
	</para>
	<para>
	  This flaw was discovered by Jan-Piet Mens, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2015-1349. [RT #38344]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  A flaw in delegation handling could be exploited to put
	  <command>named</command> into an infinite loop, in which
	  each lookup of a name server triggered additional lookups
	  of more name servers.  This has been addressed by placing
	  limits on the number of levels of recursion
	  <command>named</command> will allow (default 7), and
	  on the number of queries that it will send before
	  terminating a recursive query (default 50).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The recursion depth limit is configured via the
	  <option>max-recursion-depth</option> option, and the query limit
	  via the <option>max-recursion-queries</option> option.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The flaw was discovered by Florian Maury of ANSSI, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2014-8500. [RT #37580]
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Two separate problems were identified in BIND's GeoIP code that
	  could lead to an assertion failure. One was triggered by use of
	  both IPv4 and IPv6 address families, the other by referencing
	  a GeoIP database in <filename>named.conf</filename> which was
	  not installed. Both are covered by CVE-2014-8680. [RT #37672]
	  [RT #37679]
	</para>
	<para>
	  A less serious security flaw was also found in GeoIP: changes
	  to the <command>geoip-directory</command> option in
	  <filename>named.conf</filename> were ignored when running
	  <command>rndc reconfig</command>. In theory, this could allow
	  <command>named</command> to allow access to unintended clients.

          NXDOMAIN responses to queries of type DS are now cached separately
          from those for other types. This helps when using "grafted" zones
          of type forward, for which the parent zone does not contain a
          delegation, such as local top-level domains.  Previously a query
          of type DS for such a zone could cause the zone apex to be cached
          as NXDOMAIN, blocking all subsequent queries.  (Note: This
          change is only helpful when DNSSEC validation is not enabled.
          "Grafted" zones without a delegation in the parent are not a
          recommended configuration.)

        <para>
          NOTIFY messages that are sent because a zone has been updated
          are now given priority above NOTIFY messages that were scheduled
          when the server started up. This should mitigate delays in zone
          propagation when servers are restarted frequently.

	  When encountering an authoritative name server whose name is
	  an alias pointing to another name, the resolver treats
	  this as an error and skips to the next server. Previously
	  this happened silently; now the error will be logged to
	  the newly-created "cname" log category.

	  If named is not configured to validate the answer then
	  allow fallback to plain DNS on timeout even when we know
	  the server supports EDNS.  This will allow the server to
	  potentially resolve signed queries when TCP is being
	  blocked.

	  When files opened for writing by <command>named</command>,

	  Large-system tuning

	  When a zone contained a delegation to an IPv6 name server
	  but not an IPv4 name server, it was possible for a memory

	  Due to an inadvertent removal of code in the previous
