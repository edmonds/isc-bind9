	  New quotas have been added to limit the queries that are
	  sent by recursive resolvers to authoritative servers
	  experiencing denial-of-service attacks. When configured,
	  these options can both reduce the harm done to authoritative
	  servers and also avoid the resource exhaustion that can be
	  experienced by recursives when they are being used as a
	  vehicle for such an attack.
	</para>
	<para>
	  NOTE: These options are not available by default; use
	  <command>configure --enable-fetchlimit</command> to include
	  them in the build.

	      <option>fetches-per-server</option> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent to any single
	      authoritative server.  The configured value is a starting
	      point; it is automatically adjusted downward if the server is
	      partially or completely non-responsive. The algorithm used to
	      adjust the quota can be configured via the
	      <option>fetch-quota-params</option> option.

	  Large inline-signing changes should be less disruptive.

	  The experimental SIT extension now uses the EDNS COOKIE
	  option code point (10) and is displayed as "COOKIE:

	  "request-sit", "sit-secret" and "nosit-udp-size", are

	  Several bugs have been fixed in the RPZ implementation:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Policy zones that did not specifically require recursion
	      could be treated as if they did; consequently, setting
	      <command>qname-wait-recurse no;</command> was
	      sometimes ineffective.  This has been corrected.
	      In most configurations, behavioral changes due to this
	      fix will not be noticeable. [RT #39229]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The server could crash if policy zones were updated (e.g.
	      via <command>rndc reload</command> or an incoming zone
	      transfer) while RPZ processing was still ongoing for an
	      active query. [RT #39415]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      On servers with one or more policy zones configured as
	      slaves, if a policy zone updated during regular operation
	      (rather than at startup) using a full zone reload, such as
	      via AXFR, a bug could allow the RPZ summary data to fall out
	      of sync, potentially leading to an assertion failure in
	      rpz.c when further incremental updates were made to the
	      zone, such as via IXFR. [RT #39567]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The server could match a shorter prefix than what was
	      available in CLIENT-IP policy triggers, and so, an
	      unexpected action could be taken. This has been
	      corrected. [RT #39481]
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The server could crash if a reload of an RPZ zone was
	      initiated while another reload of the same zone was
	      already in progress. [RT #39649]
