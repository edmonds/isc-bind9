	  An incorrect boundary check in the OPENPGPKEY rdatatype
	  could trigger an assertion failure. This flaw is disclosed
	  in CVE-2015-5986. [RT #40286]
	</p></li>
<li>
<p>
	  A buffer accounting error could trigger an assertion failure
	  when parsing certain malformed DNSSEC keys.
	</p>
<p>
	  This flaw was discovered by Hanno B&ouml;ck of the Fuzzing
	  Project, and is disclosed in CVE-2015-5722. [RT #40212]

</li>
<li>
<p>
	  A specially crafted query could trigger an assertion failure
	  in message.c.
	</p>
<p>
	  This flaw was discovered by Jonathan Foote, and is disclosed
	  in CVE-2015-5477. [RT #40046]
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	  On servers configured to perform DNSSEC validation, an
	  assertion failure could be triggered on answers from
	  a specially configured server.
	</p>
<p>
	  This flaw was discovered by Breno Silveira Soares, and is
	  disclosed in CVE-2015-4620. [RT #39795]

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>
	  New quotas have been added to limit the queries that are
	  sent by recursive resolvers to authoritative servers
	  experiencing denial-of-service attacks. When configured,
	  these options can both reduce the harm done to authoritative
	  servers and also avoid the resource exhaustion that can be
	  experienced by recursives when they are being used as a
	  vehicle for such an attack.
	</p>
<p>
	  NOTE: These options are not available by default; use
	  <span><strong class="command">configure --enable-fetchlimit</strong></span> to include
	  them in the build.
	</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li><p>
	      <code class="option">fetches-per-server</code> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent to any single
	      authoritative server.  The configured value is a starting
	      point; it is automatically adjusted downward if the server is
	      partially or completely non-responsive. The algorithm used to
	      adjust the quota can be configured via the
	      <code class="option">fetch-quota-params</code> option.
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      <code class="option">fetches-per-zone</code> limits the number of
	      simultaneous queries that can be sent for names within a
	      single domain.  (Note: Unlike "fetches-per-server", this
	      value is not self-tuning.)
	    </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
	  Statistics counters have also been added to track the number
	  of queries affected by these quotas.
	</p>
</li>
<li><p>
          <span><strong class="command">dig +ednsflags</strong></span> can now be used to set
          yet-to-be-defined EDNS flags in DNS requests.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  <span><strong class="command">dig +[no]ednsnegotiation</strong></span> can now be used enable /
	  disable EDNS version negotiation.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  An <span><strong class="command">--enable-querytrace</strong></span> configure switch is
	  now available to enable very verbose query tracelogging. This
	  option can only be set at compile time. This option has a
	  negative performance impact and should be used only for
	  debugging.

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc">
<li><p>
	  Large inline-signing changes should be less disruptive.
	  Signature generation is now done incrementally; the number
	  of signatures to be generated in each quantum is controlled
	  by "sig-signing-signatures <em class="replaceable"><code>number</code></em>;".
	  [RT #37927]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  The experimental SIT extension now uses the EDNS COOKIE
	  option code point (10) and is displayed as "COOKIE:
	  &lt;value&gt;".  The existing named.conf directives;
	  "request-sit", "sit-secret" and "nosit-udp-size", are
	  still valid and will be replaced by "send-cookie",
	  "cookie-secret" and "nocookie-udp-size" in BIND 9.11.
	  The existing dig directive "+sit" is still valid and will
	  be replaced with "+cookie" in BIND 9.11.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  When retrying a query via TCP due to the first answer being
	  truncated, <span><strong class="command">dig</strong></span> will now correctly send
	  the COOKIE value returned by the server in the prior
	  response. [RT #39047]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  Retrieving the local port range from net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range
	  on Linux is now supported.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  Active Directory names of the form gc._msdcs.&lt;forest&gt; are
	  now accepted as valid hostnames when using the
	  <code class="option">check-names</code> option. &lt;forest&gt; is still
	  restricted to letters, digits and hyphens.
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  Names containing rich text are now accepted as valid
	  hostnames in PTR records in DNS-SD reverse lookup zones,
	  as specified in RFC 6763. [RT #37889]

<li><p>
	  Asynchronous zone loads were not handled correctly when the
	  zone load was already in progress; this could trigger a crash
	  in zt.c. [RT #37573]
 	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  A race during shutdown or reconfiguration could
	  cause an assertion failure in mem.c. [RT #38979]

	  Some answer formatting options didn't work correctly with
	  <span><strong class="command">dig +short</strong></span>. [RT #39291]

<li><p>
	  Malformed records of some types, including NSAP and UNSPEC,
	  could trigger assertion failures when loading text zone files.
	  [RT #40274] [RT #40285]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  Fixed a possible crash in ratelimiter.c caused by NOTIFY
	  messages being removed from the wrong rate limiter queue.
	  [RT #40350]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  The default <code class="option">rrset-order</code> of <code class="literal">random</code>
	  was inconsistently applied. [RT #40456]
	</p></li>
<li><p>
	  BADVERS responses from broken authoritative name servers were
	  not handled correctly. [RT #40427]
	</p></li>
<li>
<p>
	  Several bugs have been fixed in the RPZ implementation:
	</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle">
<li><p>
	      Policy zones that did not specifically require recursion
	      could be treated as if they did; consequently, setting
	      <span><strong class="command">qname-wait-recurse no;</strong></span> was
	      sometimes ineffective.  This has been corrected.
	      In most configurations, behavioral changes due to this
	      fix will not be noticeable. [RT #39229]
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      The server could crash if policy zones were updated (e.g.
	      via <span><strong class="command">rndc reload</strong></span> or an incoming zone
	      transfer) while RPZ processing was still ongoing for an
	      active query. [RT #39415]
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      On servers with one or more policy zones configured as
	      slaves, if a policy zone updated during regular operation
	      (rather than at startup) using a full zone reload, such as
	      via AXFR, a bug could allow the RPZ summary data to fall out
	      of sync, potentially leading to an assertion failure in
	      rpz.c when further incremental updates were made to the
	      zone, such as via IXFR. [RT #39567]
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      The server could match a shorter prefix than what was
	      available in CLIENT-IP policy triggers, and so, an
	      unexpected action could be taken. This has been
	      corrected. [RT #39481]
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      The server could crash if a reload of an RPZ zone was
	      initiated while another reload of the same zone was
	      already in progress. [RT #39649]
	    </p></li>
<li><p>
	      Query names could match against the wrong policy zone
	      if wildcard records were present. [RT #40357]
	    </p></li>
